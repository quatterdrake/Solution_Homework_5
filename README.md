ðŸ”¹ 1. Proxy Pattern â€“ Real Estate Image System
ðŸ“˜ Problem:
You're building a system for a real estate agency. Thumbnails should load immediately, but high-resolution images must load only on user demand (e.g., click-to-zoom).

âœ… Solution:
Implemented Proxy Pattern:

ImageProxy enables lazy loading of full images.

ProtectionProxyImageUploader ensures only authorized agents can upload images.

AgentSession simulates login/authentication.

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved:
Reduced memory and bandwidth consumption by loading full images only when needed.

Enhanced security by restricting image upload functionality.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Flyweight Pattern â€“ Map Marker Rendering
ðŸ“˜ Problem:
Rendering 1000+ markers on a map (hospitals, gas stations, restaurants), all with shared styles.

âœ… Solution:
Applied Flyweight Pattern:

MarkerFactory caches marker styles (hospital, gas, restaurant).

Each Marker shares a single instance of MarkerStyle rather than duplicating.

ðŸ“Š Result:
1000 markers use only 3 unique style objects.

Saves memory and improves rendering efficiency.
